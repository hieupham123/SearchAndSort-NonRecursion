president barak obama on tuesday championed nuclear energy expansion as the latest way that
feuding parties can move beyond the broken politics
the economic stimulus plan against republican criticism reflecting white house will remain
aggressive in selling its own case to the public
since a january special election in masssachusetts obama has recalibrated his strategy to
advance has agenda 123
his plan includes reaching out to republicans on tax breaks on health care and on energy
but also putting them on the spot for any refusal to help
rebuilding public confidence keeping obama in charge of the debate white house is now infusing
its communications strategy with more of the discipline
THE PRESIDENT CAST HIS PUSH FOR MORE NUCLEAR ENERGY AS BOTH ECONOMICALLY VITAL AND POLITICALLY
ATTRACTIVE TO THE OPPOSITION PARTY 345
HE ANNOUNCED MORE THAN EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR IN LOAN GUARANTEES TO BUILD THE FIRST NUCLEAR POWER
PLANT IN NEARLY THREE DECADES
A COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY BILL THAT EXPANDS CLEAR ENERGY SOURCES ASSIGNS A COST TO THE POLLUTING
EMISSIONS OF FOSSIL FUELS SO THAT NUCLEAR FUEL BECOMES MORE AFFORDABLE
THE FACT IS CHANGING THE WAYS we produce and use energy requires us to think anew 657
it requires us to act anew obama said during a stop a job training center outside washington
and it demands of us a willingness to extend our hand across some of the old divides to act in
good faith and to move beyond the broken politics of the past
that mission however remains in doubt 3452
a white house built on the long view also has gotten sharper about responding to daily criticism
from emboldened republicans
this week senior administration officials claim that the massive deficit spending economic
stimulus program has failed
in saginaw biden insisted the stimulus is working even as he acknowledged its going to take us a
while to get us out of this ditch
michigans unemployment rate is among the highest in the country 678
the chronic joblessness there and elsewhere is driving an anti incumbency fever even as the
economy by most other measures appears to be rebounding
democrats as members of the party in power are most likely to feel that anti incumbency heat at
the polls in november when house and senate seats are on the ballot
obama will head west later this week to raise money for two vulnerable democrats who face the
voters this year
on tuesday an obama ally said the frustrations of gridlock drove his decision not to run for re
election
there is just too much brain dead partisanship said in a nationally broadcast interview
obama in working to change that system he is required to work within it 980
he made this pitch for nuclear energy by saying nothing less than the economy the security of
the united states and the planets future were at stake
the president said we can not continue to be mired in the same old stale debates left and right
between environmentalists and entrepreneurs
obama aides say there is no formal reevaluation of the administrations communications strategy
as the president embarks on his second year in office
but the white house is taking an approach that is at once more aggressive and more streamlined
980
it includes more direct and rapid response to criticism more events at which the president
speaks directly to the public without the filter of the media
the intended narrative is one in which obama hears peoples frustrations and is working directly
to end them
THERE IS A LITTLE DOUBT THE PUBLIC IS ANGRY 4565
A CBS NEWS POLL IN EARLY FEBRUARY FOUND EIGHTY ONE PERCENT SAYING ITS TIME TO ELECT NEW PEOPLE
TO CONGRESS
THAT AFFECTS OBAMA WHO IS NOT UP FOR REELECTION BUT NEEDS ALLIES AND VOTES ON CAPITOL HILL TO
USHER IN THE DOMESTIC CHANGE HE HAS PROMISED

the idea can be expanded to the development of a hierarchical fuzzy relational clustering
algorithm
IN HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING EITHER SMALLER CLUSTERS ARE MERGED INTO LARGER CLUSTERS OR
THE LARGER CLUSTERS ARE DIVIDED INTO SMALLER CLUSTERS
we have applied the algorithm to relational data it can also be applied to attribute data
this might be done by first calculating pairwise distances between pairs of attribute vectors
using some suitable distance measure
such as euclidean distance measure and then converting these distances to similarities by
passing them through a suitable monotone decreasing function
